# NATS NKeys .NET (Developers preview)

This is a developers preview of the NATS NKeys library for .NET.
This library is a work in progress and is not yet ready for production use.

**NOTE**: Under development at the moment, not ready for use.
I will probably squash commits into a single initial commit before the first package is ready. - @mtmk
